/**
 * Daivs.Requests are created from click and submit events.  Davis.Requests are passed to Davis.Routes
 * and are stored in the history stack.  They are instantiated by the Davis.listener module.
 *
 * A request will have a params object which will contain all query params and form params, any named
 * params in a routes path will also be added to the requests params object.  Also included is support
 * for rails style nested form params.
 *
 * By default the request method will be taken from the method attribute for forms or will be defaulted
 * to 'get' for links. However there is support for using a hidden field called _method in your forms
 * to set the correct reqeust method.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} raw An object that contains at least a title, fullPath and method property.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *     var request = new Davis.Request({
 *       title: "foo",
 *       fullPath: "/foo/12",
 *       method: "get"
 *     })

/**
 * ## request.redirect
 * Redirects the current request to a new location.  Calling redirect on an instance of
 * Davis.Request will create a new request using the same path and title. Redirected requests
 * always have a method of 'get'.
 *
 * The request created will replace the current request in the history stack.  Redirect is most
 * often useful inside a handler for a form submit.  After succesfully handling the form, the app
 * can redirect to another path.  This means that the current form will not be re-submitted if
 * navigation through the history is with the back or forward buttons because the request that the
 * submit generated has been replaced in the history stack.
 *
 * @param {String} path The path to redirect the current request to
 *
 * ### Example:
 *     this.post('/foo', function (req) {
 *       processFormRequest(req.params)  // do something with the form request
 *       req.redirect('/bar');
 *     })

 * Converts the request to a string representation of itself by combining the method and path
 * attributes.

 * @returns {String} string representation of the request

/**
 * ## Davis.Request.forPageLoad
 * Creates a new request for the page on load.
 * This is required as requests don't occur on a page load, they are usually
 * generated from clicking links or submitting forms.
 * However the page load should still be considered as a request for the
 * JavaScript app to handle.
 *
 * @returns {Davis.Request} A request representing the current page loading.
